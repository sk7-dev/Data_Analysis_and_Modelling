# SPSS - Cryptocurrency Prediction

## Analyzing Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Investment

## Overview
This project analyzes survey data to identify factors influencing individuals to invest in cryptocurrency. It employs predictive modeling techniques such as Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to derive insights from behavioral and demographic variables.

## Input
- **Dataset**: American Trends Panel Wave 111 from the PEW Research Center.
- **Key Variables**:
  - Target: `Crypto_Invest` (Binary variable indicating investment status).
  - Features: Variables like `Age`, `Gender`, `Marital Status`, `Online_Betting`, `NFT_Invest`, and `Crypto_Know`.

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, recode variables, and validate data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Select and preprocess relevant variables.
3. **Model Training**:
   - **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification with interpretability.
   - **KNN**: For distance-based predictions.
4. **Validation**: Split data into training and validation sets to evaluate performance.

## Output
- **Model Performance**:
  - Logistic Regression: Accuracy ~77-85% (depending on subsets).
  - KNN: Accuracy ~75-84% (depending on subsets).
- **Key Insights**:
  - Men are more likely to invest in cryptocurrency.
  - Knowledge of cryptocurrency and NFTs significantly increases investment likelihood.
  - Users of online payment apps (e.g., Cash App) are more inclined to invest.

## Conclusion
This study highlights actionable insights into cryptocurrency adoption, offering a foundation for further research and policy development.
