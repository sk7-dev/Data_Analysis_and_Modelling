NOTES

The sample consisted of a general population ATP subsample that included all ATP panel members who identified Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual (LGB).The sample also included an oversample of KnowledgePanel members that identified as LGB.
ATP panelists that responded to W108 and indicated they were single and looking for a romantic partner, or who indicated they had used an online app before, were sampled with certainty.  

For a small number of respondents with high risk of identification, certain values have been randomly swapped with those of lower risk cases with similar characteristics.

METOOSUPOE/METOOOPPOE
The following variables include coded open-end responses to questions METOOSUPOE and METOOOPPOE. Up to three responses were coded for each question.
METOOSUPOE_m1
METOOSUPOE_m2
METOOSUPOE_m3
METOOOPPOE_m1
METOOOPPOE_m2
METOOOPPOE_m3

ONDPLTFRM_i_OTHER_W111
The following variables include coded open-end responses to "Some other online dating site or dating app not listed" on the question ONDPLTFRM. Up to five mentions were coded.   
ONDPLTFRM_i_OTHER_W111_OE1
ONDPLTFRM_i_OTHER_W111_OE2
ONDPLTFRM_i_OTHER_W111_OE3
ONDPLTFRM_i_OTHER_W111_OE4
ONDPLTFRM_i_OTHER_W111_OE5

The variable containing respondents' sexual orientation has been removed from this dataset due to the sensitive nature of these questions and the high risk of identification.
